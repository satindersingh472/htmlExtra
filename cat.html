            <h2>Cats</h2>
            <p>
                From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
                The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only
                domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish
                it from the wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat;
                the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for
                companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
                registries.[6]

                The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes,
                sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are
                well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing,
                growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and
                dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or
                too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] Cats also
                secrete and perceive pheromones.[8]

            <h2>Evolution</h2>
            <p>
                The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common ancestor about 10–15 million
                years ago.[42] The genus Felis diverged from other Felidae around 6–7 million years ago.[43] Results of
                phylogenetic research confirm that the wild Felis species evolved through sympatric or parapatric
                speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.[44] The domesticated cat and
                its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes[45] and roughly 20,000 genes.[46]
                The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in China around 5500 BC. This line of
                partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today.[47]

                The earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was excavated close by a
                human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200 BC. Since there is
                no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely
                brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland.[48] Scientists
                therefore assume that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent
                by rodents, in particular the house mouse (Mus musculus), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers. This
                mutual relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years. As agricultural
                practices spread, so did tame and domesticated cats.[11][6] Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the
                maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time.[49]

                The earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in Greece dates to around 1200 BC.
                Greek, Phoenician, Carthaginian and Etruscan traders introduced domestic cats to southern Europe.[50]
                During the Roman Empire they were introduced to Corsica and Sardinia before the beginning of the 1st
                millennium.[51] By the 5th century BC, they were familiar animals around settlements in Magna Graecia
                and Etruria.[52] By the end of the Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Egyptian domestic cat lineage
                had arrived in a Baltic Sea port in northern Germany.[49]

            Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven
            lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and
            a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal
            vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the
            cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the
            pelvis.Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle
            bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head

        <h3>Behavior</h3>
        <p>
            Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night.[97]
            Domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes but can range many hundreds of
            meters from this central point. They establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one study
            ranging from 7 to 28 hectares (17–69 acres).[98] The timing of cats' activity is quite flexible and varied,
            which means house cats may be more active in the morning and evening, as a response to greater human
            activity at these times.[99]

            Cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older. The daily duration
            of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 and 14 being the average. Some cats can sleep as
            much as 20 hours. The term "cat nap" for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to fall asleep (lightly)
            for a brief period. While asleep, cats experience short periods of rapid eye movement sleep often
            accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are dreaming.[10

        <h3>communication</h3>
        <p>

            Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, trilling, hissing,
            growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing.[7] Their body language, including
            position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of
            mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats. A raised tail indicates
            a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position
            in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate
            ones.[109] Feral cats are generally silent.[110]: 208  Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and
            may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head.[102]

            Purring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signaling mechanism of reassurance between
            mother cats and nursing kittens. Post-nursing cats often purr as a sign of contentment: when being petted,
            becoming relaxed,[111][112] or eating. The mechanism by which cats purr is elusive; the cat has no unique
            anatomical feature that is clearly responsible for the sound.[113]
