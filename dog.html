            <p>
                From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
                "Pooch" redirects here. For other uses, see Dog (disambiguation) and Pooch (disambiguation).
                The dog or domestic dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf, and is characterized by an upturning
                tail
                The dog is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living
                relative.
                The dog was the first species to be domesticated by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago,before the
                development of agriculture.
                Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals
                and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.<br>

            <h2>Evolution</h2>
            <p>
                The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event occurred 65 million years ago
                and brought an end to the dinosaurs and the appearance of the first carnivorans.
                The name carnivoran is given to a member of the order Carnivora. Carnivorans possess
                a common arrangement of teeth called carnassials, in which the first lower molar and
                the last upper premolar possess blade-like enamel crowns that act similar to a pair of
                shears for cutting meat. This dental arrangement has been modified by adaptation over the
                past 60 million years for diets composed of meat, for crushing vegetation, or for the loss
                of the carnassial function altogether as in seals, sea lions, and walruses. Today, not all
                carnivorans are carnivores, such as the insect-eating Aardwolf.

                The carnivoran ancestors of the dog-like caniforms and the cat-like feliforms began their separate
                evolutionary
                paths just after the end of the dinosaurs. The first members of the dog family Canidae appeared 40
                million years
                ago, of which only its subfamily the Caninae survives today in the form of the wolf-like and fox-like
                canines.
                Within the Caninae, the first members of genus Canis appeared six million years ago,[15] the ancestors
                of modern
                domestic dogs, wolves, coyotes, and golden jackals.

            <p>
                The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in
                Bonn-Oberkassel,
                Germany. Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a local
                wolf.[22]
                The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three
                having been
                sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under large, thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of canine
                distemper.[23] Earlier remains dating back to 30,000 years ago have been described as Paleolithic dogs
                but their
                status as dogs or wolves remains debated[24] because considerable morphological diversity existed among
                wolves
                during the Late Pleistocene.[1]

                This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be domesticated[9][8] in the time of
                hunter–gatherers,[7] which predates agriculture.[1] DNA sequences show that all ancient and modern dogs
                share a
                common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population which was distinct from the
                modern wolf
                lineage.[6][7] Most dogs form a sister group to the remains of a Late Pleistocene wolf found in the
                Kessleroch
                cave near Thayngen in the canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland, which dates to 14,500 years ago. The most
                recent
                common ancestor of both is estimated to be from 32,100 years ago.[25] This indicates that an extinct
                Late
                Pleistocene wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog,[8][1][26] with the modern wolf being the dog's
                nearest
                living relative.[8]

                The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal pathway into
                domestication.[24][27] The questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated have taxed
                geneticists and
                archaeologists for decades.[9] Genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000
                years ago,
                in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or eastern Asia.[10] In 2021, a
                literature
                review of the current evidence infers that the dog was domesticated in Siberia 23,000 years ago by
                ancient North
                Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across Eurasia.[22]

        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <h3>Skeleton</h3>
        <img src="dogimages/dogSkeleton.jpg" alt="skeleton of a dog">
        <p>All healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have an identical skeletal
            structure with the exception of the number of bones in the tail, although there
            is significant skeletal variation between dogs of different types.[28][29] The
            dog's skeleton is well adapted for running; the vertebrae on the neck and back
            have extensions for powerful back muscles to connect to, the long ribs provide
            plenty of room for the heart and lungs, and the shoulders are unattached to the
            skeleton allowing great flexibility.[28][29]

            Compared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since domestication
            has seen the dog's skeleton greatly enhanced in size for larger types as mastiffs
            and miniaturised for smaller types such as terriers; dwarfism has been selectively
            utilised for some types where short legs are advantageous such as dachshunds and
            corgis.[29] Most dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with
            naturally short tails have as few as three.[28]

            The dog's skull has identical components regardless of breed type, but there is
            significant divergence in terms of skull shape between types.[29][30] The three
            basic skull shapes are the elongated dolichocephalic type as seen in sighthounds,
            the intermediate mesocephalic or mesaticephalic type, and the very short and broad
            brachycephalic type exemplified by mastiff type skulls.[29][30]
        </p>
        <h3>Senses</h3>
        <p>
            A dog's senses include vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and sensitivity to Earth's
            magnetic field. Another study has suggested that dogs can see Earth's magnetic field.[31]
        </p>
        <h3>Coat</h3>
        <p>
            The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: "double" being familiar with dogs (as well as wolves)
            originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or "single", with the
            topcoat only. Breeds may have an occasional "blaze", stripe, or "star" of white fur on their chest or
            underside.[32] Premature graying can occur in dogs from as early as one year of age; this is associated with
            impulsive behaviors, anxiety behaviors, fear of noise, and fear of unfamiliar people or animals.[33]
        </p>
        <h3>Tail</h3>
        <p>There are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or corkscrew. As with
            many
            canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be
            crucial in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs the tail is traditionally docked to avoid
            injuries.
